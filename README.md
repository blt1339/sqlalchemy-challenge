This project is broken up into the following sections:
### Climate Analysis and Exploration
    This was performed in the jupyter notebook climate.ipynb.  SQLAlchemy create_engine was utilized to connect to hawaii.sqlite data and `automap_base()` to reflect tables into classes with a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.
    * Precipitation Analysis

    * Station Analysis
### Climate App
    This logic is in the python program app.py.   This program can be executed using python and then the welcome page can be accessed via http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    The following routes are available for this app:
    




### Bonus
    This was performed in the jupyter notebook climate.ipynb.  
    * Temperature Analysis I
    * Temperature Analysis II
    * Daily Rainfall Average
